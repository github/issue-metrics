"""A module for measuring the number of very active mentors

This module provides functions for measuring the number of active mentors on a
project.

This is measured by number of PR comments. We are working under the assumption
that PR comments are left in good faith to move contributors further instead of
nitpicking and discouraging them.

Open questions:
   - should there be an option to limit this to certain users, e.g. core
     maintainers?
   - should there be a limit to how many comments per PR we consider to avoid
     having the statistic dominated by contested PRs?
   - should this metric count consecutive comments coming from the same user as
     only one to avoid people unnecessarily splitting their comments to game the
     metric?
   - instead of PR comments should we count PRs on which a username was seen as
     commenter?

Functions:
    collect_response_usernames(
        issue: Union[github.Issue.Issue, None],
        discussion: Union[dict, None],
        pull_request: Union[github.PullRequest.PullRequest, None],
        max_comments_to_evaluate,
    ) -> ____________
         Collect the number of responses per username for single item. Take only
         top n comments (max_comments_to_evaluate) into consideration.
    get_number_of_active_reviewers(
        mentors: List [mentors with metrics)
        ) -> int active_number
        Count the number of mentors active at least n times
