"""A module for measuring the number of comments on pull requests.

This module provides functions for counting comments on GitHub pull requests,
excluding bot comments, and calculating statistics about comment counts.

Functions:
    count_pr_comments(
        issue: Union[github3.issues.Issue, None],
        pull_request: Union[github3.pulls.PullRequest, None],
        ignore_users: Union[List[str], None] = None,
    ) -> Union[int, None]:
        Count the number of comments on a pull request, excluding bot comments.
    get_stats_pr_comments(
        issues_with_metrics: List[IssueWithMetrics],
    ) -> Union[dict[str, float], None]:
        Calculate stats describing the comment count for a list of pull requests.
